## First week session challenges

### Javascript Challenges

1. **Create Conversation starters**

You are given two profile objects
Your challenge is to write a function called `createConversationStarters`
that will parse these objects and match up common attributes.

The expected output of this function can be an array of strings or a string that says something like:

[`'You both live in mumbai',
'she is from the Marathi community as well']`

Hint: you can use using object access syntax,
basic conditionals and array manipulation to solve this challenge

2. **Five mini challenges with arrays**

See `userApi.js` for hints and details

### React Native Challenge

Your challenge is to render a avatar card component with the ready made template that snack gives. Use object access notation to read object data from a user profile object as covered in the session.

Use the react native documentation for components like [<Image />](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/images.html) to render an image from the network.

Try to change the dimensions of the card by passing in style props using a javascript object. The documentation for the prop is found [here](https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/API/card/) in the react-native-elements library

[Here is what the output could look like](https://d2ffutrenqvap3.cloudfront.net/items/3K0H371b2o0N3x3j0Z39/react-native-avatar.PNG?v=4bdaa88d)
